This study compares some of the popular machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive
Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Extreme Gradient Boosting to
classify the tweets into three different categories: cyberbullying
based on religion, cyberbullying based on ethnicity, or no
cyberbullying. First, various data-cleaning approaches are used
to clean the tweet data. After the data is clean and ready, the
word embedding techniques, such as a bag of words and term
frequency-Inverse document frequency, are used to convert the
words into mathematical vectors. Finally, the model will be fitted
using the combination of the above-mentioned word embedding
techniques and machine learning algorithms.
